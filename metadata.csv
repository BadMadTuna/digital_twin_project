segment_0001.wav|My witness statement.
segment_0002.wav|As I write this...
segment_0003.wav|I'm 94.
segment_0004.wav|I've had the most extraordinary life.
segment_0005.wav|It's only now I appreciate.
segment_0006.wav|How extraordinary.
segment_0007.wav|I've been lucky enough to spend my life exploring the wild places of our planet and making films about the creatures that live there.
segment_0009.wav|I've traveled widely around the globe.
segment_0010.wav|I've experienced the living world first hand in all its variety and wonder.
segment_0011.wav|and witnessed some of its greatest spectacles.
segment_0012.wav|and most gripping dramas.
segment_0013.wav|As a boy, I dreamed, like so many other boys, of traveling to distant, wilder places to look at the natural world in its pristine state and even find animals that were new to science.
segment_0014.wav|Now I find it hard to believe that I've managed to spend so much of my life doing exactly that.
segment_0015.wav|1937
segment_0016.wav|World population 2.3 billion.
segment_0017.wav|Carbon in the atmosphere.
segment_0018.wav|280 parts per million.
segment_0019.wav|Remaining Wilderness
segment_0020.wav|66%
segment_0021.wav|When I was 11 years old I lived in Leicester in the middle of England.
segment_0022.wav|At that time, it wasn't unusual for a boy of my age to get on a bicycle, ride off into the countryside, and spend a whole day away from home.
segment_0023.wav|And that is exactly what I did.
segment_0024.wav|Every child explores, just turning over a stone and looking at the animals beneath is exploring.
segment_0025.wav|It never occurred to me to be anything other than fascinated when watching what was going on in the natural world about me.
segment_0026.wav|My older brother had another view.
segment_0027.wav|Lester had an amateur dramatic society that put on productions of near professional standards, and although he persuaded me every now and then to join him and speak a couple of lines in walk-on parts...
segment_0030.wav|Instead, as soon as the weather was warm enough...
segment_0031.wav|I would cycle off to the eastern part of the county where there were rocks full of beautiful and intriguing fossils.
segment_0032.wav|They were not. It's true, the bones of dinosaurs.
segment_0033.wav|The honey-coloured limestone had been deposited as mud at the bottom of an ancient sea, so no one could expect to find the remains of such land-living monsters in them.
segment_0035.wav|I discovered the shells of sea-living creatures, ammonites, some six inches or so across.
segment_0036.wav|coiled like ram's horn.
segment_0037.wav|Others the size of hazelnuts, inside which were tiny scaffolds of calcite that had supported the gills with which the creatures within had breathed.
segment_0038.wav|and I knew of no greater thrill than picking up a lighter looking boulder.
segment_0039.wav|giving it a smart blow with a hammer.
segment_0040.wav|and watching it fall apart to reveal one of these marvellous shells glinting in the sunlight.
segment_0041.wav|And I reveled in the thought.
segment_0042.wav|that the first human eye is to gaze upon it.
segment_0044.wav|I had believed from a very early age.
segment_0045.wav|that the most important knowledge was that which brought an understanding of how the natural world worked.
segment_0046.wav|It was not laws invented by human beings that interested me.
segment_0047.wav|but the principles that govern the lives of animals and plants.
segment_0048.wav|not the history of kings and queens, or even the different languages that had been developed by different human societies, but the truths that had governed the world around me long before humanity had appeared in it.
segment_0049.wav|Why were there so many different kinds of ammonites?
segment_0050.wav|Why was this one different from that?
segment_0051.wav|Did it live in a different way?
segment_0052.wav|didn't live in a different area.
segment_0053.wav|I soon discovered that plenty of other people had asked such questions and had found a lot of the answers, and that these answers could be put together to form the most marvellous of all stories.
segment_0054.wav|the history of life.
segment_0055.wav|The story of the development of life on Earth is for the most part one of slow steady change.
segment_0056.wav|Every creature whose remains I found in the rocks had spent its entire life being tested by its environment.
segment_0057.wav|Those that happen to be better at surviving are reproducing.
segment_0058.wav|passed on their characteristics.
segment_0059.wav|Those that didn't?
segment_0061.wav|Over billions of years life forms slowly changed and became more complex, more efficient, often more specialised.
segment_0062.wav|and their long story, detail by detail, could be deduced from what could be found in the rocks.
segment_0063.wav|The Leicestershire Limestones had recorded only a tiny moment of it.
segment_0064.wav|But more chapters could be found in the specimens that the City Museum had on display.
segment_0065.wav|And to find out yet more, I decided that when the time came...
segment_0066.wav|I will try to go to university.
segment_0067.wav|There I learned another truth.
segment_0068.wav|This long story of gradual change had been violently interrupted at points.
segment_0069.wav|Every 100 million years or so, after all those painstaking selections and improvements,
segment_0070.wav|Something catastrophic happened.
segment_0071.wav|A mass extinction.
segment_0072.wav|For different reasons at different times in the Earth's history, there had been a profound rapid global change to the environment.
segment_0073.wav|to which so many species have become so exquisitely adapted.
segment_0074.wav|The Earth's Life Support Machine.
segment_0076.wav|and the miraculous assemblage of fragile interconnections which held it together.
segment_0078.wav|great numbers of species suddenly disappeared.
segment_0079.wav|leaving only a few.
segment_0080.wav|All that evolution was undone.
segment_0081.wav|These monumental extinctions created boundaries in the rocks that you could see if you knew where to look and how to recognize them.
segment_0082.wav|Below the boundary there were many different life forms.
segment_0085.wav|Such mass extinctions have happened five times in life's four billion year history.
segment_0086.wav|Each time, nature has collapsed.
segment_0087.wav|leaving just enough survivors to start the process once more.
segment_0088.wav|The last time it happened, it's thought that a meteorite over 10 kilometers in diameter struck the Earth's surface with an impact.
segment_0089.wav|2 million times more powerful.
segment_0090.wav|than the largest hydrogen bomb ever tested.
segment_0091.wav|It landed in a bed of gypsum.
segment_0092.wav|So, some think, it sent sulphur high into the atmosphere.
segment_0093.wav|to fall across the globe as rain, sufficiently acidic to kill vegetation.
segment_0094.wav|and dissolve the bodies of plankton in the surface waters of the oceans.
segment_0095.wav|The dust cloud that arose blocked the light from the sun to such a degree that it may have reduced the rate of plant growth for several years.
segment_0096.wav|Flaming remnants of the blast may have showered back to Earth, causing firestorms across the Western Hemisphere.
segment_0097.wav|The burning world would have added carbon dioxide and smoke to the already polluted air, warming the earth
segment_0098.wav|door een greenhouse effect.
segment_0099.wav|and because the meteorite landed on the coast...
segment_0100.wav|It initiated colossal tsunamis that swept across the globe, destroying coastal ecosystems and sending marine sand significantly distances inland.
segment_0101.wav|It was an event that changed the course of natural history.
segment_0102.wav|wiping out three quarters of all species, including anything on land larger than the size of a domestic dog.
segment_0103.wav|It ended the 175 million year reign of the dinosaur.
segment_0105.wav|would have to rebuild.
segment_0106.wav|For 66 million years since then, nature has been at work.
segment_0107.wav|reconstructing the living world.
segment_0108.wav|recreating and refining a new diversity of species.
segment_0109.wav|and one of the products of this rebooting of life.
segment_0110.wav|was humanity.
segment_0111.wav|Our own evolution is also recorded in the rocks.
segment_0112.wav|Fossils of our close ancestors are much rarer than those of ammonites because they first evolved only two million years ago
segment_0113.wav|And there's a further difficulty.
segment_0114.wav|The remains of landliving animals are not, for the most part, sealed away beneath the accumulating sediments, as are those of marine creatures.
segment_0115.wav|Instead, they're smashed by the destructive powers of the Baking Sun.
segment_0116.wav|the driving rain and frost.
segment_0117.wav|But they do exist.
segment_0118.wav|and the few remains we have found of our ancestors.
segment_0119.wav|show that we first evolved.
segment_0121.wav|As we did so, our brains began to increase in size at such a rate...
segment_0122.wav|as to suggest that we were acquiring one of our most characteristic features.
segment_0123.wav|a capacity to develop cultures to a unique degree.
segment_0124.wav|To an evolutionary biologist, the term culture describes the information that can be passed from one individual to another.
segment_0125.wav|by teaching or by imitation.
segment_0126.wav|Copying the ideas or actions of others seems to us to be easy.
segment_0127.wav|But that's because we excel at it.
segment_0128.wav|Only a handful of other species show any signs of having a culture.
segment_0129.wav|Chimpanzees and bottlenose dolphins are two of them.
segment_0130.wav|but no other species has anything approaching the capacity for culture.
segment_0132.wav|Culture transformed the way we evolve.
segment_0133.wav|It was a new way by which our species became adapted for life on Earth.
segment_0134.wav|Whereas other species depended on physical change over generations,
segment_0135.wav|We could produce an idea that brought significant change within a single generation.
segment_0136.wav|tricks such as finding the plants that yield water even during a drought.
segment_0137.wav|Crafting a stone tool for skinning a kill
segment_0138.wav|Lighting a fire or cooking a meal?
segment_0139.wav|could be passed from one human to another during a single lifetime.
segment_0140.wav|It was a new form of inheritance that didn't rely on the genes which an individual received from its parents.
segment_0141.wav|So now the pace of our change increased.
segment_0142.wav|our ancestors' brains expanded at extraordinary speed.
segment_0143.wav|enabling us to learn, store and spread ideas.
segment_0144.wav|But ultimately, the physical changes in their bodies slowed to almost a halt.
segment_0145.wav|by some 200,000 years ago.
segment_0146.wav|anatomically modern humans, homo sapiens, people like you and me.
segment_0148.wav|We've changed physically very little since then.
segment_0149.wav|What has changed spectacularly.
segment_0151.wav|at the beginning of our existence as a species.
segment_0152.wav|Our culture was centered upon a lifestyle of hunting and gathering.
segment_0153.wav|We were exceptionally good at both.
segment_0154.wav|We equipped ourselves with the material products of our culture, such as hooks to catch fish, and knives to butcher deer.
segment_0155.wav|We learned how to control fire for cooking and use stones to grind grain.
segment_0156.wav|But despite our ingenious culture...
segment_0157.wav|Our lives were not easy.
segment_0158.wav|The environment was harsh and more importantly unpredictable.
segment_0159.wav|The world in general was a lot colder than now.
segment_0160.wav|the sea level was much lower.
segment_0161.wav|Fresh water was harder to find.
segment_0162.wav|and global temperatures fluctuated greatly within relatively short periods of time.
segment_0163.wav|We may have had bodies and brains very like those we have now, but because the environment was so unstable
segment_0164.wav|It was hard to survive.
segment_0165.wav|Data from genetic studies of modern day humans suggests that in fact 70,000 years ago
segment_0166.wav|Those climatic hazards left us susceptible to events that nearly exterminated us.
segment_0167.wav|our entire species.
segment_0168.wav|may have been reduced to as few as 20,000 fertile adults.
segment_0169.wav|If we were to develop much further...
segment_0170.wav|we needed a little stability.
segment_0171.wav|the retreat of the last glaciers 11,700 years ago.
segment_0172.wav|brought that stability.
segment_0173.wav|The Holocene
segment_0174.wav|The part of the Earth's history that we think of was our time.
segment_0175.wav|has been one of the most stable periods in our planet's long history.
segment_0176.wav|For 10,000 years, the average global temperature did not vary up or down by more than 1 degree centigrade.
segment_0177.wav|We don't know exactly what produced this stability.
segment_0178.wav|but the richness of the living world may well have had something to do with it.
segment_0179.wav|phytoplankton microscopic plants floating near the ocean surface
segment_0180.wav|and vast forests extending right round the globe in the north.
segment_0181.wav|locked away a great deal of carbon.
segment_0182.wav|and so help to maintain a balanced level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
segment_0183.wav|Huge herds of grazing animals kept the grasslands rich and productive by fertilizing the soils and stimulating new growth by grazing them.
segment_0184.wav|mangrove swamps and coral reefs along the coast.
segment_0185.wav|provided nurseries for young fish that, when mature, ranged into open waters and enriched the ocean's ecosystems.
segment_0186.wav|a dense multi-layered belt of rainforest around the equator.
segment_0187.wav|Harness the sun's energy.
segment_0188.wav|and added moisture and oxygen to the global air currents.
segment_0189.wav|and great white expanses of snow and ice of the northern and southern ends of the Earth reflected sunlight back into space, cooling the whole Earth.
segment_0190.wav|like a gigantic air conditioner.
segment_0191.wav|So the flourishing biodiversity of the Holocene...
segment_0192.wav|helped to moderate the global temperatures of the Earth.
segment_0193.wav|and the living world settled into a gentle, reliable, annual rhythm.
segment_0194.wav|The Seasons.
segment_0195.wav|on the tropical plains.
segment_0196.wav|dry and rainy seasons alternated with clockwork regularity.
segment_0197.wav|In Asia and Oceania, the winds change direction at the same time each year.
segment_0198.wav|delivering the monsoon on cue.
segment_0199.wav|In northern regions, the temperatures rose above 15 degrees centigrade in March, triggering the spring.
segment_0200.wav|and then stayed high until October.
segment_0202.wav|and brought autumn.
segment_0203.wav|The Holocene was our Garden of Eden.
segment_0204.wav|Its rhythm of seasons was so reliable.
segment_0205.wav|that it gave our species the opportunities we needed.
segment_0206.wav|and we took advantage of them.
segment_0207.wav|Almost as soon as the environment stabilized, groups of people living in the Middle East began to abandon gathering plants and hunting animals and took to a completely new way of life.
segment_0208.wav|They started to farm.
segment_0209.wav|The change was not deliberate.
segment_0210.wav|It didn't happen by design.
segment_0211.wav|The path to agriculture was long haphazard and accidental, and due more to luck than to foresight.
segment_0212.wav|In the Middle East, the lands had all the characteristics needed for such happy accidents.
segment_0213.wav|They lie on the crossroads between three continents, Africa, Asia and Europe.
segment_0214.wav|So for millions of years...
segment_0215.wav|A species of plants and animals from all three?
segment_0216.wav|have both passed through and established themselves here.
segment_0217.wav|The hillsides and floodplains were colonized by plants such as the wild ancestors of today's wheat.
segment_0220.wav|Bees and lentils.
segment_0221.wav|all species that produce seeds.
segment_0222.wav|so rich in nutriment that they can survive the prolonged dry seasons.
segment_0223.wav|Such edible morsels must have attracted people every year.
segment_0224.wav|If they were able to gather more seeds than they needed immediately, they doubtless stored them.
segment_0225.wav|as some other mammals and birds do.
segment_0226.wav|so that they could be eaten during the winter when food is scarce.
segment_0227.wav|At some point, the hunter-gatherers stopped their wanderings.
segment_0228.wav|and settle down.
segment_0229.wav|Secure in the knowledge.
segment_0230.wav|that their stored seeds would provide them with food when nothing else was easily available.
segment_0231.wav|Wild cattle?
segment_0232.wav|goats, sheep and pigs.
segment_0233.wav|all existed naturally in this region.
segment_0234.wav|Initially, they must have been taken from the wild, but they too became domesticated within a few thousand years of the start of the Holocene.
segment_0235.wav|Again, there will have been many intermediate and doubtless unintentional steps in the journey from wild to tame.
segment_0236.wav|At first the hunters selected males to kill.
segment_0237.wav|and protected breeding females.
segment_0238.wav|in order to boost the populations.
segment_0239.wav|Evidence for this has been found by scientists studying the bones of animals around ancient village sites.
segment_0240.wav|The humans may also have chased off other animal predators or lived without meat entirely for periods of the year to maintain the wild stock.
segment_0241.wav|Ultimately, they not only caught but kept animals alive for long periods and began to breed them.
segment_0242.wav|inevitably selecting as their stock.
segment_0243.wav|those individuals that were less aggressive and more tolerant.
segment_0244.wav|With time, all of these developments were enhanced by other innovations.
segment_0245.wav|Building grain stores, herding.
segment_0246.wav|Digging irrigation channels, tilling and planting, adding manure.
segment_0247.wav|Agriculture had arrived.
segment_0248.wav|Perhaps the advent of farming was almost inevitable.
segment_0249.wav|when a species as intelligent and inventive as ours
segment_0250.wav|met a climate as stable as the Holocenes.
segment_0252.wav|The habit of farming started independently in at least 11 separate regions around the world.
segment_0253.wav|gradually developing cultivated strains of a very wide range of crops, including familiar ones like potatoes, maize, rice and sugarcane.
segment_0254.wav|and domesticated animals.
segment_0255.wav|such as donkeys, chickens.
segment_0257.wav|and bees.
segment_0258.wav|Farming transformed the relationship between humankind and nature.
segment_0259.wav|We were, in a very small way, taming a part of the wild world.
segment_0260.wav|confronting our environment.
segment_0261.wav|to a modest degree.
segment_0262.wav|We built walls to protect plants from the wind.
segment_0263.wav|We shaded our animals from the sun by planting trees.
segment_0264.wav|Using their manure, we fertilize the land where they graze.
segment_0265.wav|We ensured that our crops flourished in times of drought.
segment_0266.wav|keeping them watered by building channels from rivers and lakes.
segment_0267.wav|We removed plants that competed with the ones we found useful.
segment_0268.wav|and covered whole hillsides.
segment_0269.wav|with those that we particularly favoured.
segment_0270.wav|Both the animals and the plants we selected in this way.
segment_0271.wav|also began to change.
segment_0272.wav|As we protected the grazing animals, they no longer needed to guard against attacks from predators or fight for access to females.
segment_0273.wav|We weeded our plots so that our food plants could grow without competition from other species.
segment_0274.wav|and get all the nitrogen, water and sunlight that they needed.
segment_0275.wav|They produced larger grains and bigger fruits and tubers.
segment_0276.wav|The animals became morbidable as we took away their need for weariness and aggression.
segment_0277.wav|Their ears flopped, their tails curled. They continued to make the yapping, bleating and whining noises of their younger years.
segment_0278.wav|even when they were mature.
segment_0279.wav|Perhaps because in many ways...
segment_0280.wav|they were eternally youthful.
segment_0281.wav|being fed and protected by us, their surrogate parents.
segment_0282.wav|and we were also changing from a species that was moulded by nature.
segment_0283.wav|into one that had the ability to mold other species.
segment_0284.wav|to match its own requirements.
segment_0285.wav|The farmer's work was hard.
segment_0286.wav|They suffered frequent droughts and famine.
segment_0287.wav|but eventually they were able to produce more than they needed for their own immediate requirements.
segment_0288.wav|Compared to their hunter-gathering neighbors, they were able to raise bigger families.
segment_0289.wav|These extra sons and daughters were useful.
segment_0290.wav|not only to tend the crops and livestock
segment_0291.wav|but to assist their family in retaining possession of its fields.
segment_0292.wav|Farming made land more valuable than it had been in its wild state.
segment_0293.wav|and the farmers began to build more permanent shelters to maintain their claims.
segment_0294.wav|The plots belonging to different families inevitably varied in soil type.
segment_0295.wav|water availability and aspects.
segment_0296.wav|So some crops and herds fared better than others.
segment_0297.wav|After feeding the family
segment_0298.wav|The farmers were able to use any surplus to trade.
segment_0299.wav|Farming communities came together at open markets to barter their wares.
segment_0300.wav|they began to exchange food for other assets and for skills.
segment_0301.wav|The farmers needed stone, twine, oil and fish.
segment_0302.wav|They wanted the products of carpenters, masons and toolmakers.
segment_0303.wav|who now, for the first time, were able to trade for food rather than spending time growing it.
segment_0304.wav|as the number of trades increased.
segment_0305.wav|the markets developed into towns and then cities in many of the fertile river valleys.
segment_0306.wav|As each new valley was settled, some farmers moved to the next in search of fresh fields.
segment_0307.wav|neighboring tribes of hunter-gatherers.
segment_0308.wav|Trading with the farming communities
segment_0309.wav|merged with them as they grew, and the practice of farming spread at speed.
segment_0310.wav|up the rivers into every watershed.
segment_0311.wav|Civilization had started.
segment_0312.wav|He'd gathered pace with each generation and with each technical innovation.
segment_0313.wav|Water power, steam power.
segment_0314.wav|Electrification were invented and refined.
segment_0315.wav|and eventually all the achievements with which we are familiar today were established.
segment_0316.wav|but each generation in these ever more complex societies.
segment_0317.wav|was able to develop and progress only because the natural world continued to be stable.
segment_0318.wav|and could be relied upon to develop the commodities and the conditions that we needed.
segment_0319.wav|the benign environment of the Holocene.
segment_0320.wav|and the marvellous biodiversity that guaranteed it.
segment_0321.wav|became more important to us than ever.
segment_0322.wav|1954
segment_0323.wav|world population.
segment_0324.wav|2.7 billion.
segment_0325.wav|Carbon in the atmosphere, 310 parts per million.
segment_0326.wav|Remaining Wilderness
segment_0327.wav|64%
segment_0328.wav|After studying the natural sciences at university and doing my national service in the Royal Navy
segment_0329.wav|I joined the Infant BBC Television Service.
segment_0330.wav|It had started in 1936, the first in the world, using two small studios in Alexander Palace in North London.
segment_0331.wav|It was suspended when the Second World War erupted.
segment_0332.wav|But in 1946, it began again using the same cameras in the same studios.
segment_0333.wav|All these programs were live and in black and white.
segment_0334.wav|and they could only be seen in London and Birmingham.
segment_0335.wav|My job was to produce non-fiction programmes of all kinds.
segment_0336.wav|but as the number and variety of programmes shown each evening increased.
segment_0337.wav|I started to specialize in natural history.
segment_0338.wav|To start with, we showed animals brought to the studios from the London Zoo.
segment_0339.wav|They were placed on a table covered by a doormat.
segment_0340.wav|and usually handled by one of the zoo's experts.
segment_0341.wav|But that made them look like freaks or oddities.
segment_0342.wav|I yearn to let viewers see them in their proper surroundings.
segment_0344.wav|where their varied shapes and colours made sense.
segment_0345.wav|And eventually I worked out a way in which I might do that.
segment_0346.wav|I made a plan with Jack Lester, the curator of reptiles in the Lunton Zoo.
segment_0347.wav|He would suggest to the zoo's director that he might go to Sierra Leone in West Africa, which he knew well.
segment_0348.wav|and that I would go with him, with the cameraman, to film what he did.
segment_0349.wav|After each film sequence showing Jack at work in the wilderness...
segment_0350.wav|He would then appear live in the studio.
segment_0351.wav|show the actual animal that he had caught?
segment_0352.wav|and explains something about its natural history.
segment_0353.wav|It would be excellent publicity for the zoo.
segment_0354.wav|and the BBC would get a new kind of animal program.
segment_0355.wav|We called it Zoo Quest.
segment_0356.wav|So in 1954...
segment_0357.wav|I set off for Africa with Jack and Charles Lagos, a young cameraman who had worked in the Himalayas and who used the lightweight 60mm film camera that we would need.
segment_0358.wav|The first programme was transmitted in December 1954.
segment_0360.wav|The day after it had appeared...
segment_0361.wav|Jack was taken to hospital with a disease so serious.
segment_0362.wav|that it would eventually kill him.
segment_0363.wav|There was no way in which he could appear in the studio for a second program the following week.
segment_0364.wav|Only one person could do that job.
segment_0366.wav|So I was instructed to leave the control gallery from which I directed the live cameras and instead stand in the studio.
segment_0367.wav|grappling with the pythons, monkeys, rare birds and chameleons that the expedition had brought back.
segment_0368.wav|So began my career in front of the camera.
segment_0369.wav|The series turned out to be very popular.
segment_0370.wav|and I started to travel the world making ZooQuest programs.
segment_0371.wav|Guyana, Borneo, New Guinea.
segment_0372.wav|Madagascar Paraguay.
segment_0373.wav|Wherever I went, I found wilderness.
segment_0374.wav|sparkling coastal seas, vast forests, immense open grasslands.
segment_0375.wav|Year after year...
segment_0376.wav|I explored such places with cameras, recording the wonders of the natural world for viewers back home.
segment_0377.wav|The people who helped us, guiding us through these jungles and deserts, couldn't understand how I found it so difficult to locate animals.
segment_0378.wav|animals that were plainly obvious to them.
segment_0379.wav|It was some time before I acquired the skills that I needed to become reasonably competent at living and working in the wilderness.
segment_0380.wav|The programmes became extremely popular.
segment_0381.wav|People have never seen a pangolin before on television.
segment_0382.wav|They'd never seen us, Ruth.
segment_0383.wav|We showed them the largest lizard, the so-called dragon.
segment_0384.wav|that lives on Komodo.
segment_0385.wav|a small island in central Indonesia.
segment_0386.wav|and we filmed for the first time birds of paradise dancing in the New Guinea forest.
segment_0387.wav|The 1950s were a time of great optimism.
segment_0388.wav|The Second World War that has left Europe in ruin.
segment_0389.wav|was beginning to fade in the memory.
segment_0390.wav|The whole world wanted to move on.
segment_0391.wav|Technological innovation was booming, making our lives easier.
segment_0392.wav|introducing us to new experiences.
segment_0393.wav|It felt that nothing would limit our progress.
segment_0394.wav|the future was going to be exciting and bring everything we'd ever dreamed of.
segment_0395.wav|Who was I traveling the globe with the task of exploring nature?
segment_0397.wav|That was before any of us were aware.
segment_0398.wav|that there were problems.

segment_0405.wav|62%
segment_0406.wav|If there is a single wilderness of which everyone has a clear mental image
segment_0407.wav|It's the Great Plains of Africa with their elephants, rhinos, giraffes and lions.
segment_0408.wav|My first visit to the plains was in 1960.
segment_0409.wav|While the wildlife I encountered was wonderful, it was the sheer expanse of the wide open landscapes that captured my attention.
segment_0410.wav|The Maasai word, Serengeti, means endless plains.
segment_0411.wav|It's an apt description.
segment_0412.wav|You can be in one spot on the Serengeti and the place appears to be totally empty of animals.
segment_0413.wav|and then the next morning there are one million wildebeest, a quarter of a million zebra, half a million gazelles.
segment_0414.wav|A few days after that...
segment_0416.wav|over the horizon.
segment_0418.wav|you would be forgiven for thinking that these planes were endless.
segment_0419.wav|when they can swallow up such immense hurt.
segment_0420.wav|At that time, it appeared inconceivable that human beings, a single species...
segment_0421.wav|might one day have the power to threaten something as vast.
segment_0422.wav|поэтому Vamos a iyi ηθ acquaintance και ευχαριστώ самого ορτόςиваемτου που λες GoodmentOps και完 τέλ Croatian
segment_0423.wav|Yet that was exactly the fear of visionary scientist Bernhard Jimmich.
segment_0424.wav|He was the director of the Frankfurt Zoo.
segment_0425.wav|and had revived it from a wreckage of broken cages and bomb craters after the war.
segment_0426.wav|In the 1950s he became a familiar face on German television presenting films on African wildlife.
segment_0427.wav|is most famous.
segment_0428.wav|Serengeti shall not die.
segment_0429.wav|had won the Academy Award for documentary in 1959.
segment_0430.wav|The film recorded his work to try and map the movements of the wildebeest herds.
segment_0431.wav|He and his son Michael, who was a qualified pilot...
segment_0432.wav|had used a small plane to follow the herds over the horizon.
segment_0433.wav|They charted them as they moved across rivers, through woodlands and over national borders, and in doing so
segment_0434.wav|he began to understand the workings of the entire Serengeti ecosystem.
segment_0435.wav|It became apparent that the grasses, surprisingly, needed the herbivores as much as the herbivores needed the grasses.
segment_0436.wav|Without the grazers, the grasses wouldn't be so dominant.
segment_0437.wav|They had evolved to withstand being copped by a million voracious mouths.
segment_0438.wav|When the herd's teeth sliced off the leaves close to the ground level,
segment_0439.wav|The plants used reserves of sustenance in their bases just below ground to regrow.
segment_0440.wav|When the herds hooves broke up the soil and the plants shed their seeds, the next generation of grass was established.
segment_0441.wav|When the herds moved on, the grasses were able to regrow quickly, nourished by the piles of manure that the animals had left behind them.
segment_0442.wav|What looked like a path of destruction in the herd's wake.
segment_0443.wav|was in fact
segment_0444.wav|an essential stage.
segment_0445.wav|in the grass's life cycle.
segment_0446.wav|If there were too few grazers, the grasses would disappear, shaded by taller plants that would come to dominate in the herd's absence.
segment_0447.wav|It was the tale of interdependence characteristic of the discoveries then being made by the emerging science of ecology.
segment_0448.wav|The task of naming and classifying the world species that had preoccupied zoologists in the 19th century was being superseded by other pursuits.
segment_0449.wav|zoologists were now becoming more specialized.
segment_0450.wav|Some studied the workings of animal cells invisible to the naked eye, using ever more powerful microscopes and x-rays, a pursuit that in 1953 resulted in the discovery of the structure of DNA, the very essence of inheritance.
segment_0451.wav|Others, the ecologists, developed statistical techniques and surveying equipment.
segment_0452.wav|to study animal communities living together out in the wild.
segment_0453.wav|In the 1950s, these ecologists were beginning to make sense of the seeming chaos of the outside world.
segment_0454.wav|and coming to understand how all life was interconnected in a web of infinite variety with everything relying on everything else.
segment_0455.wav|Animals and plants had a close and sometimes intimate relationship with one another.
segment_0456.wav|Yet, although tightly interwoven, these ecosystems were not necessarily robust.
segment_0457.wav|Even a small knock in the wrong place could put the whole community off balance.
segment_0458.wav|Chimek knew that this must be true even for an ecosystem as large as the Serengeti.
segment_0459.wav|His survey flights soon revealed that it was in fact
segment_0460.wav|the very size of the plains that prevented that ecosystem from collapsing.
segment_0461.wav|Without immense space, the herds could not move over great distances and give the different areas of wild pasture the respite they required.
segment_0462.wav|between attacks.
segment_0463.wav|The grazers would grind the leaves down to the very roots.
segment_0464.wav|and ultimately bring about their own starvation.
segment_0465.wav|The predators might benefit for a short while as their prey became enfeebled by starvation.
segment_0466.wav|But with time, they too would die.
segment_0467.wav|without its vast space.
segment_0468.wav|the Serengeti ecosystem would lose its balance.
segment_0470.wav|motivated by the knowledge that Tanzania and Kenya were about to claim independence and might well give in to demands to turn their planes into farmland.
segment_0471.wav|Jim Ek through his films and other activities.
segment_0472.wav|gave strength to those anxious to protect the grasslands and save the space for nature.
segment_0473.wav|the African states of their own volition.
segment_0474.wav|took visionary action.
segment_0475.wav|Tanzania banned human settlement in the section of the Serengeti that lay within its borders.
segment_0476.wav|a ruling that caused a great deal of controversy.
segment_0477.wav|In Kenya, new reserves were created in the area around the Mara River to preserve the entire route of the Serengeti migration.
segment_0478.wav|The point was made.
segment_0479.wav|Nature is far from unlimited.
segment_0480.wav|The wild is finite.
segment_0481.wav|It needs protecting.
segment_0482.wav|and a few years later...
segment_0484.wav|became obvious to everyone.
segment_0485.wav|1968
segment_0486.wav|World population 3.5 billion.
segment_0487.wav|Carbon in the atmosphere.
segment_0488.wav|323 parts per million.
segment_0489.wav|Remaining Wilderness?
segment_0490.wav|59%
segment_0491.wav|During the ZooQuest expeditions, I'd spent time with people in distant parts of the world.
segment_0492.wav|who led lives very different from my own, and I started to learn more about them and the way they viewed existence.
segment_0493.wav|I felt it would be valuable to bring their lives and perspectives to the home audience.
segment_0494.wav|So the emphasis of my overseas filming began to change.
segment_0495.wav|and I began to make films showing the lives and customs of the people far from Europe.
segment_0496.wav|in de Zuid-Eeste Stadion.
segment_0497.wav|in the islands of the Western Pacific.
segment_0498.wav|and in Australia.
segment_0499.wav|I became so engaged with these peoples.
segment_0500.wav|that I decided I ought to know something more of their beliefs and the way they organized their lives.
segment_0501.wav|The BBC allowed me to resign from full-time employment as a producer.
segment_0502.wav|and for the next few years to spend six months in 12 making programmes, and then a similar length of time studying anthropology at the London School of Economics.
segment_0503.wav|It seemed a marvelous arrangement.
segment_0504.wav|But it didn't last long.
segment_0505.wav|In the 1960s the BBC was given the responsibility of introducing colour television into Britain, which till then had been in black and white.
segment_0506.wav|This would be done by a new network called BBC2.
segment_0507.wav|Its programs would also explore new styles and subjects.
segment_0508.wav|What exactly they were was not defined. That would be the responsibility of its controller.
segment_0509.wav|To anyone interested in broadcasting, such a job was irresistible.
segment_0510.wav|At any rate, when I was offered it.
segment_0511.wav|I found it so.
segment_0512.wav|And in 1965...
segment_0513.wav|I abandoned my anthropological studies.
segment_0514.wav|and return to the staff of the BBC.
segment_0515.wav|and to an executive desk.
segment_0516.wav|So it was that in 1968, four days before Christmas...
segment_0517.wav|I was standing at the back of the International Control Room in the BBC's television centre
segment_0518.wav|watching pictures being sent back to Earth.
segment_0519.wav|from the Apollo 8 mission.
segment_0520.wav|We all knew that Apollo 8
segment_0522.wav|For the first time, a crew would leave the Earth's orbit.
segment_0523.wav|travel all the way to the moon, circle it,
segment_0524.wav|taking pictures of its far side, never before glimpsed by humankind.
segment_0525.wav|and then return to Earth.
segment_0526.wav|It was to be a dry run.
segment_0527.wav|for the attempt to land on the moon.
segment_0528.wav|which President Kennedy had been determined should happen before the end of the decade.
segment_0529.wav|While the mission's focus was certainly on the Moon, it was pictures of the Earth.
segment_0530.wav|that unexpectedly captured the crews and our attention.
segment_0531.wav|Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Unders.
segment_0532.wav|were the first people to move far enough away from the Earth.
segment_0533.wav|to be able to see the whole planet.
segment_0534.wav|with the naked eye.
segment_0535.wav|and it made a deep impression.
segment_0536.wav|Three and a half hours into the flight, Jim Lovell spoke his thoughts to NASA.
segment_0537.wav|Well, I can see the entire Earth now out of the center window.
segment_0539.wav|Beautiful was the word that all three kept uttering.
segment_0540.wav|Anders rushed to get the mission still camera and become the first person to take a photograph of the whole earth
segment_0541.wav|It's a spectacular shot.
segment_0543.wav|upside down, almost filling frame with South America, lit by the December summer sun.
segment_0544.wav|Yet this photograph, like all those taken on the mission...
segment_0545.wav|remained undeveloped in the camera until touchdown.
segment_0546.wav|What we were waiting for in television studios across the world.
segment_0547.wav|was an electronic picture.
segment_0548.wav|As the time for the first scheduled broadcast from the craft approached...
segment_0549.wav|More people were tuning in around the world than had ever before watched a single television program.
segment_0550.wav|We were greeted incredibly by a good picture of the interior of the capsule.
segment_0551.wav|After a few pleasantries, Frank Borman explained that Anders, who was operating the video camera, was waiting for the spacecraft to roll into a position where he could point the lens through the window at the Earth.
segment_0552.wav|Now we're coming up on the view that we really want you to see," he said to us all.
segment_0553.wav|But at that moment the picture disappeared.
segment_0554.wav|Mission control at Houston scrambled to tell the crew that the picture was breaking up.
segment_0555.wav|We all waited helpless.
segment_0556.wav|After a few minutes of fiddling live on air, we were told that the telephoto lens was the problem.
segment_0557.wav|and switched to the wide angle lens but there was still no picture.
segment_0558.wav|You don't have a lens cover on there, do you, said Houston?
segment_0560.wav|Borman replied curtly.
segment_0561.wav|We checked that as a matter of fact.
segment_0562.wav|Then the first picture suddenly appeared on all our screens.
segment_0563.wav|A disc was visible in the frame, but the wide lens made it look quite small.
segment_0564.wav|The bigger problem, however, was exposure.
segment_0565.wav|The earth was just too bright, flooded with light from the sun.
segment_0566.wav|It's coming in as a real bright blob on the screen, reported Houston. It's hard to tell what we're looking at.
segment_0567.wav|That is the earth said Borman, almost apologetic.
segment_0568.wav|Unable to improve the image, the crew gave us a tour of the interior of the spacecraft.
segment_0569.wav|We watch the astronauts having their zero-gravity lunch.
segment_0570.wav|Jim Lovell wished his mother a happy birthday.
segment_0571.wav|and the transmission ended.
segment_0572.wav|I hope we can get that other lens fixed," said Borman.
segment_0573.wav|We had to wait a whole day for the next broadcast to witness another attempt.
segment_0574.wav|On the 23rd of December
segment_0575.wav|The global viewership had grown to an estimated 1 billion people, by far the biggest audience in history.
segment_0576.wav|Mormon began with a proud announcement.
segment_0577.wav|Hello Houston, this is Apollo 8.
segment_0578.wav|We have the television camera pointed directly at the Earth now.
segment_0579.wav|The crew had no viewfinder.
segment_0580.wav|So in fact they could not know exactly what was in frame.
segment_0581.wav|We're getting a darn good look at the corner of it, said Houston.
segment_0582.wav|But then the earth swiftly swung off and disappeared.
segment_0583.wav|The telephoto lens was working, at least, but there followed agonising minutes of left a bit, right a bit, as the crew, working blind, attempted to point the lens at the earth while the craft yawed gently at a distance of 180,000 miles.
segment_0584.wav|Yet even though the earth was slipping and sliding across the television screen
segment_0585.wav|The fact was...
segment_0586.wav|that a quarter of humankind was watching itself.
segment_0587.wav|You hardly dared blink.
segment_0588.wav|That was the Earth.
segment_0589.wav|that held the whole of humanity.
segment_0590.wav|apart from the three men in the space car.
segment_0591.wav|who were taking the picture.
segment_0592.wav|With that one image at Christmas in 1968
segment_0593.wav|Television enabled humankind.
segment_0594.wav|to understand something.
segment_0595.wav|that no one before had been able to visualize in such a vivid way.
segment_0596.wav|perhaps the most important truth of our time.
segment_0597.wav|that our planet...
segment_0598.wav|is small.
segment_0601.wav|It's the only place we have.
segment_0602.wav|the only place where life exists as far as we can tell.
segment_0603.wav|It is uniquely precious.
segment_0604.wav|The pictures from Apollo 8.
segment_0605.wav|had transformed the mindset.
segment_0606.wav|of the population of the world.
segment_0607.wav|As Anders himself said
segment_0608.wav|We came all this way to explore the moon.
segment_0609.wav|and the most important thing.
segment_0610.wav|is that we discovered the Earth.
segment_0611.wav|we had all simultaneously realized.
segment_0612.wav|that our home was not limitless.
segment_0613.wav|there was an edge.
segment_0614.wav|to our existence.
segment_0615.wav|1971
segment_0616.wav|World population 3.7 billion.
segment_0617.wav|carbon in the atmosphere.
segment_0618.wav|326 parts per million.
segment_0619.wav|Remaining Wilderness
segment_0620.wav|58 percent.
segment_0621.wav|When I had accepted the administrative job at the BBC in 1965
segment_0622.wav|and asked that I be allowed every two or three years to leave my desk for a few weeks and make a programme.
segment_0623.wav|That way, I maintained I would be able to keep up with the ever-changing technology of program making and in 1971.
segment_0624.wav|I thought of a possible subject.
segment_0625.wav|Until the early 20th century, European travellers venturing beyond their continent into distant unexplored corners of the earth.
segment_0626.wav|had to travel on foot.
segment_0627.wav|If the country ahead was totally unknown, they recruited porters to carry all the food, the tents, and the other equipment that would be needed if they were to be self-sufficient, far from civilisation.
segment_0628.wav|But in the 20th century,
segment_0629.wav|The development of the internal combustion engine put a stop to that.
segment_0630.wav|Explorers now use Land Rovers and Jeeps.
segment_0631.wav|like aircraft or even helicopters.
segment_0632.wav|I knew of only one place where great discoveries were still being made by explorers traveling entirely on foot.
segment_0634.wav|The interior of this thousand mile long island lying north of Australia
segment_0635.wav|is filled with steep mountain ranges covered with tropical forest.
segment_0636.wav|Even in the 1970s, there were still patches of it that no outsider had yet entered.
segment_0637.wav|and walking with a long line of porters was still the only way that anyone could do so.
segment_0638.wav|Such an expedition would surely make a fascinating film.
segment_0639.wav|At the time, the eastern half of New Guinea was administered by Australia.
segment_0640.wav|I got in touch with friends in Australian television.
segment_0641.wav|They found out that a mining company had asked for permission to go into one of these unknown areas to prospect for minerals.
segment_0642.wav|Government policy, however, stipulated that no one was allowed to do such a thing before it had been established whether or not there were any people living there.
segment_0643.wav|Aerial photographs had not revealed any huts or other buildings, but there were one or two tiny pinpricks in the carpet of forest.
segment_0644.wav|that might indicate man-made clearing.
segment_0645.wav|None were big enough to allow a helicopter to land.
segment_0646.wav|The only way to discover what they were was to send in a patrol on foot.
segment_0647.wav|and I, together with the camera team, could accompany them if I really wanted to do so.
segment_0648.wav|My plan was simple.
segment_0649.wav|The nearest European settlement to the area in question was a small government station called Ambunti on the Seapic, the great river that runs roughly eastwards parallel to the north coast of the island before emptying into the Pacific.
segment_0650.wav|The government officer who would lead the expedition, Laurie Bragg, was based there.
segment_0651.wav|and he would recruit some porters.
segment_0652.wav|We would charter a float plane that would land on the river alongside his station.
segment_0654.wav|It turned out to be the most exhausting journey that I've ever made.
segment_0655.wav|Laurie had managed to assemble a hundred porters.
segment_0656.wav|But even that was not enough to carry all the food that we would need.
segment_0657.wav|We would have to have an airdrop of more supplies after about three weeks.
segment_0658.wav|We also had to travel across the grain of the country.
segment_0659.wav|Every morning, soon after dawn, we started walking.
segment_0660.wav|cutting our way through the densest forest I've ever encountered.
segment_0661.wav|Hauling ourselves up steep muddy slopes to the crest of a ridge.
segment_0662.wav|and then slithering down the sodden undergrowth on the other side to wade across a small winding river and then do the same thing over and over again.
segment_0663.wav|At four o'clock every afternoon we stop.
segment_0665.wav|and put up tarpaulins to give a shelter from the drenching rains that would start promptly at five.
segment_0666.wav|After three and a half weeks of this, one of the porters noticed human footprints in the forest on the edge of the patch we had cleared.
segment_0667.wav|Someone had been close to our camp the previous night.
segment_0669.wav|We followed the tracks.
segment_0670.wav|Night after night, having pitched our tents, we put out gifts.
segment_0671.wav|Cakes of salt?
segment_0672.wav|knives and packets of glass beads.
segment_0673.wav|One of the porters was stationed to sit on a tree stump and call out every few minutes saying that we were friends and were bringing gifts.
segment_0674.wav|But it was unlikely that the people we were following, whoever they were...
segment_0675.wav|would understand him, for there are over a thousand mutually incomprehensible languages spoken in New Guinea.
segment_0676.wav|even small groups.
segment_0677.wav|had their own distinct language.
segment_0678.wav|Night after night we call.
segment_0679.wav|Morning after morning the gifts lay where we had left them.
segment_0680.wav|After three further weeks of walking, our supplies were running low.
segment_0681.wav|We made camp and for the next two days the porters laboriously cut down huge trees to create a clearing on which a helicopter might drop fresh supplies.
segment_0682.wav|The drop was successful and accurate.
segment_0683.wav|and we set off.
segment_0684.wav|the porters once again with reassuringly heavy loads, but not complaining for we've been on short rations.
segment_0685.wav|Four weeks after we had started, we were nearing country that had already been mapped.
segment_0686.wav|It seemed the expedition and our film would have no satisfying conclusion.
segment_0687.wav|And then one morning, I woke up beneath my carpool and...
segment_0688.wav|and saw outside a group of small men standing within a couple of yards of me.
segment_0689.wav|None of them was more than about a meter and a half tall.
segment_0691.wav|except for a broad belt of bark into which they had pushed a bunch of leaves at the front and the back.
segment_0692.wav|Several had what I later discovered were bats teeth.
segment_0693.wav|stuck through holes that they'd pierced in the sides of their noses.
segment_0694.wav|Hugh, the cameraman who always stepped with his camera within arm's reach, fully loaded and ready to shoot, was already recording.
segment_0695.wav|The men stared at us, wide-eyed.
segment_0696.wav|as though they'd never seen our light before.
segment_0697.wav|I doubt us did the same.
segment_0698.wav|I've never seen anyone like them either.
segment_0699.wav|To my surprise, I found that it was not difficult to communicate with them.
segment_0700.wav|I tried by gestures to indicate that we were short of food.
segment_0701.wav|They pointed to their mouths, nodded, and opened their string bags to show us roots, probably Taro.
segment_0702.wav|that they've been gathering.
segment_0703.wav|I pointed to cakes and salt that we had brought with us.
segment_0704.wav|It's used as currency all over New Guinea.
segment_0706.wav|we'd started to trade.
segment_0707.wav|Lorry then asked them the names of the nearest rivers.
segment_0708.wav|That was more difficult to explain, but they eventually understood what he wanted and began to list them.
segment_0709.wav|How many did they know?
segment_0710.wav|They counted them, touching first their fingers one by one.
segment_0711.wav|tapping places up their forearm, their elbow.
segment_0712.wav|and continuing up the arm.
segment_0713.wav|and ending on the side of the neck.
segment_0714.wav|In fact, Laurie was not particularly interested in the actual names of the rivers or how many there were.
segment_0715.wav|He wanted to know what gesture they used to indicate number.
segment_0716.wav|He knew the counting gestures used by other groups in the area.
segment_0717.wav|and the ones used by these little people would tell him what trading contacts they might have.
segment_0718.wav|After ten minutes or so the men started to wave their arms and roll their eyes, indicating that they were going to leave.
segment_0719.wav|We waved back in response, trying to invite them to return in the morning with more food.
segment_0721.wav|The following morning they reappeared with more roots as we had hoped they would do.
segment_0722.wav|We asked if we might see where they were camped and perhaps meet their women and children.
segment_0723.wav|After some confusion, or was it perhaps reluctance?
segment_0725.wav|and led us off into the forest.
segment_0726.wav|We followed a few yards behind them.
segment_0727.wav|It was hard going.
segment_0728.wav|The vegetation was very thick.
segment_0729.wav|We lost sight of them as we rounded the trunk of a gigantic tree.
segment_0730.wav|And on the other side...
segment_0731.wav|There was no sign of them.
segment_0734.wav|But there was no reply.
segment_0735.wav|Were we walking into an ambush?
segment_0736.wav|We had no idea.
segment_0737.wav|After calling for several minutes...
segment_0738.wav|returned and walked back to camp.
segment_0739.wav|I had had a vision of how all human beings had once lived.
segment_0740.wav|In small groups, they found all they needed in the natural world around them.
segment_0741.wav|the resources they relied upon was self-renewing.
segment_0742.wav|They produced little or no waste.
segment_0743.wav|They lived sustainably.
segment_0744.wav|in balance with their environment.
segment_0745.wav|in a way that could continue effectively forever.
segment_0746.wav|A few days later...
segment_0747.wav|I was back in the 20th century.
segment_0748.wav|and behind my desk.
segment_0749.wav|in the television centre.
segment_0750.wav|1978
segment_0751.wav|World population 4.3 billion.
segment_0752.wav|Carbon in the atmosphere.
segment_0753.wav|335 parts per million.
segment_0754.wav|Remaining wilderness.
segment_0755.wav|55 percent.
segment_0756.wav|BBC2 had pioneered one particularly ambitious format, a series of 13, 50 minute or one hour programmes that methodically examined a big and important subject.
segment_0757.wav|The first of these was devised to demonstrate the high quality of the new colour system the BBC had adopted by showing the most beautiful and famous paintings, sculptures and buildings produced in Europe.
segment_0758.wav|over the past thousand years.
segment_0759.wav|It was written by the art historian Sir Kenneth Clark.
segment_0760.wav|and it took three years to make.
segment_0761.wav|Two and a half million people watched in Britain.
segment_0762.wav|Double that number did so in the United States.
segment_0763.wav|He got rave reviews.
segment_0764.wav|It was such a success that I immediately commissioned a sequel.
segment_0765.wav|This one would examine the history of Western science.
segment_0766.wav|That in turn was to be followed by a series to mark the bicentenary of the foundation of the United States. And there would be yet others.
segment_0767.wav|But it was very clear to me that the format should also be used to tell the greatest story of all.
segment_0768.wav|the history of life itself.
segment_0769.wav|It would be the most illuminating series that anyone could wish to make.
segment_0770.wav|and I yearn to do so myself.
segment_0771.wav|But it couldn't be combined with doing any other job.
segment_0772.wav|I had now, however, been an administrator for eight years, and that I thought...
segment_0773.wav|was enough.
segment_0774.wav|So I decided to leave the BBC once again.
segment_0775.wav|and then suggest the idea to whoever my successor might be.
segment_0776.wav|In due course that happened. The series was accepted.
segment_0777.wav|I called it Life on Earth.
segment_0778.wav|He took some time to assemble a production team.
segment_0779.wav|I wrote the scripts for the 13 episodes more or less in one go.
segment_0780.wav|Camera crews were recruited and organised to film at least 600 different animal species in at least 30 countries.
segment_0781.wav|I would appear in vision occasionally to set the scene, to explain complicated theoretical points, introduce new topics or leave frame in one continent and explain in the next frame that we had arrived in another to continue the story.
segment_0782.wav|I would have to travel with a crew to a series of different locations.
segment_0783.wav|It would take one and a half million miles of travel to capture the story. Two long trips around the globe for me.
segment_0784.wav|and the continuous labour of six different camera teams, each of whom would be away for months at a time.
segment_0785.wav|We'd also need a few sequences that were so difficult to get that they would be best tackled by camera operators who had special knowledge and skills in filming particular kinds of subjects.
segment_0786.wav|Oceanic plankton, spiders, hummingbirds.
segment_0787.wav|Coral fish. Bats.
segment_0788.wav|and dozens of others.
segment_0789.wav|Relating the history of life.
segment_0790.wav|was the biggest single project I had ever tackled.
segment_0791.wav|and would take the next three years of my life.
segment_0792.wav|It was an exciting prospect.
segment_0793.wav|One of the key sequences planned for the program describing the evolution of monkeys and apes
segment_0794.wav|concerned the development
segment_0795.wav|of the opposable thumb.
segment_0796.wav|This is the anatomical characteristic.
segment_0797.wav|that enables a monkey to grasp a branch.
segment_0798.wav|or a human being to wield a tool.
segment_0799.wav|and eventually hold a pen, an ability that played a crucial part in the rise of our own species and our civilizations.
segment_0800.wav|We could have chosen any species of monkey or ape to illustrate the point.
segment_0801.wav|But John Sparks, the director of the episode, decided that it would be most dramatic to do so by filming gorillas.
segment_0802.wav|He had discovered that an extraordinary American biologist, Diane Fosse,
segment_0803.wav|had been living with a group of rare mountain gorillas in the central African state of Rwanda.
segment_0804.wav|and had so accustomed them to the presence of human beings that even strangers, providing Diana comforted them.
segment_0805.wav|could get quite close to them.
segment_0806.wav|He contacted her.
segment_0807.wav|the animals with which she worked.
segment_0808.wav|were seriously endangered.
segment_0809.wav|the human population of Rwanda was growing extremely swiftly, and the mountain forests in which the gorillas lived.
segment_0810.wav|was being felled by the local people to make way for cultivated fields.
segment_0811.wav|Less than 300 mountain gorillas were left.
segment_0812.wav|Their appearance on television might draw the attention of the world to their plight.
segment_0813.wav|With that in her mind, Diana agreed to help us.
segment_0814.wav|and in January 1978
segment_0815.wav|We set out for Rwanda.
segment_0816.wav|We landed at Ruangheri, a tiny airstrip as close as we could get to Dayan's camp.
segment_0817.wav|From there we would have several hours walking up the volcanoes Frank.
segment_0818.wav|to reach the high altitude forest where Diane lived.
segment_0819.wav|We were met by Ian Redmond, a young scientist who was working with Diane.
segment_0820.wav|He had very bad news.
segment_0821.wav|A young male gorilla that Diane had known since his birth.
segment_0822.wav|and was particularly fond of.
segment_0823.wav|had been found dead and horribly mutilated.
segment_0824.wav|Poachers had shot him.
segment_0825.wav|They had cut off his head and his hands to sell to traders.
segment_0826.wav|who would turn them into souvenirs.
segment_0827.wav|Diane was grief-stricken.
segment_0828.wav|She was also seriously ill with a lung infection, so she had been unable to leave camp.
segment_0830.wav|she would do her best to help us.
segment_0831.wav|The climb to her camp was long and arduous.
segment_0832.wav|When at last we arrive...
segment_0833.wav|We found her in bed in her cabin, coughing blood.
segment_0834.wav|She was clearly seriously ill.
segment_0835.wav|but she insisted that she would be well enough to lead us to her gorillas.
segment_0836.wav|The next day she was still very frail.
segment_0837.wav|So it was Ian who led us into the forest.
segment_0838.wav|I had never been in country anything like it.
segment_0839.wav|Stunted, gnarled trees, wreathed in mist, stood above thickets of giant celery and nettles that reached up to our shoulders.
segment_0840.wav|Once we had found the gorillas' tracks, following them through such undergrowth was easy.
segment_0841.wav|After an hour or so we could hear crashes ahead of us.
segment_0842.wav|and we knew we were close.
segment_0843.wav|as we move cautiously forwards.
segment_0844.wav|Ian started to make a series of loud grunting noises.
segment_0845.wav|to signal our presence.
segment_0846.wav|It was important not to catch the gorillas by surprise.
segment_0847.wav|If we did, the dominant male might charge us.
segment_0848.wav|We came to a clearing, an inn called Holt.
segment_0849.wav|We must now sit out in the open.
segment_0850.wav|so that the gorillas could see us.
segment_0851.wav|Once they knew we were within, they would be unlikely to take fright.
segment_0852.wav|After a few minutes rest, we set off again and soon caught up with a family group of them.
segment_0853.wav|They were feeding, ripping up the vegetation by the handful.
segment_0854.wav|We sat and watched enthralled.
segment_0855.wav|until after a few minutes they got to their feet.
segment_0856.wav|and leisurely strolled away.
segment_0857.wav|We had been accepted, Ian said.
segment_0860.wav|The following day with Ian as our guide...
segment_0861.wav|we filmed the gorillas foraging from a respectful distance.
segment_0862.wav|They took virtually no notice of us.
segment_0863.wav|Eventually John suggested that I said something directed to camera explaining what it was like to be sitting near them.
segment_0864.wav|We moved slowly towards a group busy feeding.
segment_0865.wav|and I cautiously moved closer to them.
segment_0866.wav|until I thought they would be visible in the background.
segment_0867.wav|I looked back at the camera and spoke.
segment_0868.wav|There is more meaning and mutual understanding in exchanging a glance with the gorilla, I said quietly.
segment_0869.wav|than with any other animal I know.
segment_0871.wav|their hearing, their sense of smell.
segment_0872.wav|are so similar to ours.
segment_0873.wav|that they see the world in much the same way as we do.
segment_0874.wav|We live in the same sort of social groups.
segment_0875.wav|with largely permanent family relationships.
segment_0876.wav|They walk around on the ground as we do.
segment_0877.wav|though they are immensely more powerful than we are.
segment_0879.wav|if there were ever a possibility of escaping the human condition.
segment_0880.wav|and living imaginatively.
segment_0881.wav|in another creature's world.
segment_0882.wav|It must be with the gorilla.
segment_0883.wav|The male is an enormously powerful creature.
segment_0884.wav|but he only uses his strength.
segment_0885.wav|when he's protecting his family.
segment_0886.wav|and it's very rare that there's violence within the group.
segment_0887.wav|So it seems really very unfair.
segment_0888.wav|that man should have chosen the gorilla to symbolize everything that is aggressive and violent.
segment_0889.wav|when that is the one thing that the gorilla is not.
segment_0891.wav|I wish people to know that these animals...
segment_0892.wav|were not the brutal wild beasts of legend.
segment_0893.wav|They were our cousins.
segment_0894.wav|and that we ought to care for them.
segment_0895.wav|The awful truth was that the process of extinction that I had seen as a boy in the rocks
segment_0896.wav|was happening right here around me.
segment_0897.wav|to animals with which I was now familiar.
segment_0898.wav|our closest relatives.
segment_0899.wav|And we were responsible.
segment_0900.wav|When we found them the next day, they were not far from where we had left them.
segment_0901.wav|They had settled on a slope on the far side of a small stream.
segment_0902.wav|Martin Saunders set up his camera.
segment_0903.wav|Dickie Byrd, the sound recordist, fixed a small radio microphone to my shirt.
segment_0904.wav|The time had come, John said.
segment_0905.wav|for me to say something.
segment_0906.wav|about the evolutionary significance of the opposable thumb.
segment_0907.wav|I crept down a slope to a small stream.
segment_0909.wav|and crawled up the opposite side to a point where I thought that Martin and his camera would be able to see both me and them.
segment_0910.wav|John gave me the thumbs up.
segment_0911.wav|But before I could say anything...
segment_0912.wav|Something landed on my head.
segment_0914.wav|and found a huge female gorilla had emerged from the vegetation immediately behind me and put her hand on my head.
segment_0915.wav|She looked straight at me with her deep brown eyes.
segment_0916.wav|Then she removed her hand from her head.
segment_0917.wav|and pull down my lower lip.
segment_0918.wav|to look inside my mouth.
segment_0919.wav|This was not, I thought.
segment_0920.wav|the moment to talk about the evolutionary significance.
segment_0921.wav|of the opposable thumb.
segment_0922.wav|Something then landed on my legs.
segment_0923.wav|Two infant gorillas were sitting on my feet.
segment_0924.wav|and fiddling with my bootlaces.
segment_0926.wav|in terms of minutes and seconds, this interaction continued.
segment_0927.wav|I have no real idea.
segment_0928.wav|It was certainly several minutes.
segment_0929.wav|I was in a delirium of happiness.
segment_0930.wav|Then the youngsters got bored with my bootlaces.
segment_0931.wav|and ambled away.
segment_0932.wav|Their mother watched them?
segment_0933.wav|Heaved herself to her feet.
segment_0934.wav|to lumber after them.
segment_0935.wav|I kept back to the film crew, overwhelmed with the feeling of extraordinary privilege.
segment_0936.wav|We had to leave the following morning.
segment_0937.wav|As we said goodbye to Diane
segment_0938.wav|She made me promise to try and raise money to help protect the wonderful creatures.
segment_0939.wav|for which she cared so much.
segment_0941.wav|the day after we got back to London.
segment_0942.wav|We have filmed the world's biggest primate.
segment_0943.wav|I thought now that life on Earth should also include shots of the biggest creature that has ever existed.
segment_0945.wav|The great whales have been hunted for millennia by brave men in canoes using nothing more than a hand-held harpoon.
segment_0946.wav|To begin with, the balance of power was with the whale.
segment_0947.wav|Not only did they dwarf their human hunters,
segment_0948.wav|but they were able to dive within seconds and escape into the depths of the ocean.
segment_0949.wav|In the 20th century, however, that balance tipped dramatically the other way.
segment_0950.wav|We invented ways of tracking whales down and stabbing them with harpoons that had explosive heads.
segment_0951.wav|Factories, some floating, some on land, were built that were capable of processing several giant carcasses in a day.
segment_0952.wav|whaling had become industrialised.
segment_0953.wav|By the time I was born...
segment_0954.wav|50,000 whales were being killed every year.
segment_0955.wav|to supply an established market for their oil, their meat and their bones.
segment_0956.wav|The first whales evolved from land-living creatures.
segment_0957.wav|The size of terrestrial animals is limited by the mechanical strength of bone.
segment_0958.wav|above a certain weight.
segment_0959.wav|Bone Breaks
segment_0960.wav|Aquatic animals, however, are supported by water.
segment_0961.wav|so whales can grow much bigger than any land animal.
segment_0962.wav|And they do.
segment_0963.wav|Their nostrils migrated to the tops of their heads.
segment_0964.wav|Their forelimbs and tails became paddles.
segment_0965.wav|and their hide limbs eventually vanished.
segment_0966.wav|For tens of millions of years, they were important members of the complex ecosystems of the open ocean.
segment_0967.wav|crisscrossing the seas in their hundreds of thousands.
segment_0968.wav|A key problem restricting life in the open ocean.
segment_0969.wav|is availability of nutrients.
segment_0970.wav|Where conditions are right, plants and animals live in the surface waters and, when they die, drift continuously downward as what's known as marine snow.
segment_0971.wav|Where nutrients are not freely available, the surface waters of the ocean can become almost sterile.
segment_0972.wav|Just as land plants need fertilizer as well as sun and water, so phytoplankton.
segment_0973.wav|The photosynthesizing foundation of the ocean food web need nitrogenous compounds in the sunlit surface waters if they're to thrive.
segment_0974.wav|There are places in the ocean where the decomposed marine snow is stirred.
segment_0975.wav|and carried upwards by the currents flowing over submarine mountains and ridges and here the phytoplankton and hence fish populations can flourish.
segment_0976.wav|but the rest of the open ocean would remain a vast blue desert.
segment_0977.wav|Were it not for the whales?
segment_0978.wav|They are so big that when they dive to feed in the depths or rise to the surface to breathe
segment_0979.wav|they create a great stirring of the water around them.
segment_0980.wav|That helps keep nutrients near the surface.
segment_0981.wav|and when they defecate the waters around them are also greatly enriched.
segment_0982.wav|This whale pump, as it's often termed...
segment_0983.wav|is now recognised as a significant process in maintaining the fertility of the open ocean.
segment_0984.wav|Indeed, whales are now thought to be responsible for bringing more important nutrients to surface waters in some parts of the ocean.
segment_0985.wav|than the outflows of local rivers.
segment_0986.wav|The ocean of the Holocene
segment_0987.wav|needed its whales to remain productive.
segment_0988.wav|in the 20th century.
segment_0989.wav|Men killed close to three million of them.
segment_0990.wav|Wales cannot withstand such a level of hunting for long.
segment_0991.wav|given the chance their very long live.
segment_0992.wav|Sperm whales can live for 70 years.
segment_0993.wav|The females are not sexually mature until they're nine.
segment_0994.wav|Their pregnancy lasts over a year.
segment_0995.wav|and they give birth only once in every three to five years.
segment_0996.wav|as the industrial whalers became more and more efficient.
segment_0997.wav|they selected the largest animals when they had the choice.
segment_0998.wav|for they were the most profitable.
segment_0999.wav|The whales were unable to give birth fast enough.
segment_1000.wav|to replace their debt.
segment_1001.wav|When we started to pan the filming of Life on Earth...
segment_1002.wav|No one, as far as we could discover, had ever filmed a living blue whale out in the open ocean.
segment_1003.wav|We plan to change that.
segment_1004.wav|But in the 1970s, their population had been reduced.
segment_1005.wav|from an estimated 250,000 before industrial whaling began.
segment_1006.wav|to no more than a few thousand.
segment_1007.wav|distributed widely over the great expanses of the open ocean and still being chased by whalers
segment_1008.wav|they were virtually impossible to find.
segment_1010.wav|we went in search of humpbacks off Hawaii.
segment_1011.wav|We had an additional tool in our kit.
segment_1012.wav|to help us find them.
segment_1014.wav|In the late 1960s,
segment_1015.wav|and American biologist Roger Payne.
segment_1016.wav|had turned from recording the ultrasonic sounds of bats.
segment_1017.wav|to investigating claims from the US Navy.
segment_1018.wav|that there were songs in the ocean.
segment_1019.wav|The Navy had set up listening stations for Soviet submarines, and as well as the signature sound of propellers, they were detecting strange, almost musical serenades.
segment_1020.wav|Pain discovered!
segment_1021.wav|that the chief source of these songs
segment_1022.wav|were the 5,000 or so humpback whales that were still alive at the time.
segment_1023.wav|His recordings reveal that humpback songs are long and complex.
segment_1024.wav|and of such low frequency that they can carry for hundreds of kilometers through the water.
segment_1025.wav|Humpbacks living in the same part of the ocean learn their songs from each other.
segment_1026.wav|Each song has its own distinct theme.
segment_1027.wav|on which each individual male will invent his own variations.
segment_1028.wav|These change over time.
segment_1029.wav|whales you might say.
segment_1030.wav|have a musical culture.
segment_1031.wav|Payne released his recordings on vinyl discs in the 1970s.
segment_1032.wav|and they became hugely popular, transforming the public perception of Wales.
segment_1033.wav|Creatures that have been viewed as little more than a source of animal oil now became personalities.
segment_1034.wav|Their mournful songs were interpreted
segment_1035.wav|as cries for help.
segment_1036.wav|In the highly charged political atmosphere of the 1970s, a powerful shared conscience suddenly stirred.
segment_1037.wav|An anti-wailing campaign began with a few passionate supporters.
segment_1038.wav|and rapidly developed into a mainstream activity.
segment_1039.wav|Human beings have pursued animals to extinction many times in our history, but now that pursuit was visible in the shaky handheld video footage brought back by brave anti-wailing campaigners.
segment_1040.wav|and it was seen to be no longer acceptable.
segment_1041.wav|The surface of the ocean slicked with blood.
segment_1042.wav|the butchery in the factories could not be concealed.
segment_1043.wav|and the killing of whales turned from a harvest
segment_1044.wav|into a crime.
segment_1045.wav|Nobody wanted animals to become extinct.
segment_1046.wav|People were beginning to care for the natural world.
segment_1047.wav|as they became more aware of it.
segment_1048.wav|And television was a way of helping them to do so.
segment_1049.wav|all around the world.
segment_1050.wav|After three years of work...
segment_1051.wav|Life on Earth was transmitted in 1979.
segment_1052.wav|It was sold to a hundred territories worldwide.
segment_1053.wav|and watched by an estimated half a billion people.
segment_1054.wav|The series opened with an introduction I called The Infinite Variety.
segment_1055.wav|A broad survey of animal and plant diversity
segment_1056.wav|to establish at the outset of the series.
segment_1057.wav|that variety is indeed crucial to life.
segment_1058.wav|after 11 further chapters expressing the twists and turns in the journey that brought about such variety.
segment_1059.wav|the 13th and final episode concentrated on just one species.
segment_1061.wav|I didn't want to suggest that humanity was in some way separate from the rest of the animal kingdom.
segment_1062.wav|We do not have a special place.
segment_1063.wav|We are not the preordained and final pinnacle of evolution.
segment_1064.wav|We are just another species.
segment_1065.wav|on the tree of life.
segment_1066.wav|Nonetheless, we've broken free from many of the constraints that affect all other species. So, in the last episode of the series, I stood in St Peter's Square in Rome, surrounded by a great crowd of individual Homo sapiens from all over the world.
segment_1067.wav|and I tried to make the point.
segment_1068.wav|You and I, I said.
segment_1069.wav|belong to the most widespread and dominant species of animal on earth.
segment_1070.wav|We live on the ice caps.
segment_1071.wav|at the polls.
segment_1072.wav|and in the tropical jungles of the equator.
segment_1073.wav|We've climbed the highest mountain and dived deep into the seas.
segment_1074.wav|We've even left the Earth.
segment_1075.wav|and set foot on the moon.
segment_1076.wav|We are certainly the most numerous large animal.
segment_1077.wav|There are something like 4,000 million of us today.
segment_1078.wav|and we have reached this position with meteoric speed.
segment_1079.wav|It's all happened within the last 2000 years or so.
segment_1080.wav|We seem to have broken loose from the restrictions that have governed the activities and numbers of other animals.
segment_1081.wav|I was now in my fifties.
segment_1082.wav|And there were twice the number of people on the planet as there had been when I was born.
segment_1083.wav|humans had become increasingly separate.
segment_1084.wav|from the rest of life on earth, living in a different and unique way.
segment_1085.wav|We had eliminated almost all our predators.
segment_1086.wav|Most of our diseases were under control.
segment_1087.wav|We had developed ways of producing food to order.
segment_1088.wav|and of living in great comfort.
segment_1089.wav|unlike all other species in the history of life on Earth.
segment_1090.wav|We were free.
segment_1091.wav|from the pressures of evolutionary natural selection.
segment_1092.wav|Our bodies had not changed significantly in 200,000 years.
segment_1093.wav|But our behaviour and our societies had become increasingly detached from the natural environment that surrounds us.
segment_1094.wav|There was nothing left to restrict us.
segment_1095.wav|Nothing to stop us.
segment_1096.wav|and as we stopped ourselves, we would continue to consume the Earth's physical resources until we had used them up.
segment_1097.wav|The courageous efforts of Diane Fossey
segment_1098.wav|the successes of the anti-wailing campaign
segment_1099.wav|Peter Scott's rescue of the Hawaiian goose.
segment_1100.wav|the reintroduction into the wild of the Arabian Oryx.
segment_1101.wav|the creation of tiger reserves in India, all the work being done by a growing army of conservationists.
segment_1102.wav|passionately raising funds and pushing for policies to protect precious species would not be enough.
segment_1103.wav|And because homo sapiens always wants more...
segment_1104.wav|the next stage was inevitable.
segment_1105.wav|whole habitats would soon start to disappear.
segment_1106.wav|1989
segment_1107.wav|World population 5.1 billion.
segment_1108.wav|Carbon in the atmosphere?
segment_1109.wav|353 parts per million.
segment_1110.wav|Remaining Wilderness?
segment_1111.wav|49 percent.
segment_1112.wav|I saw my first Arangutan on the 24th of July 1956, on the third of my ZooQuest journeys.
segment_1113.wav|It was a memorable encounter, my first wild great ape.
segment_1114.wav|A giant male, a furry red form swaying in the branches, peering down at me with interest and apparently some disdain.
segment_1115.wav|The film we took of him was far from perfect.
segment_1116.wav|He was half hidden and silhouetted against the light, but as far as I knew, television had never shown a shot of one in the wild before.
segment_1117.wav|Local hunters from the long house in which we were staying, halfway up the Mahakam River in eastern Borneo, had found it for us.
segment_1118.wav|As we left, one of them took a shot at it with his gun.
segment_1119.wav|I turned round outraged. Why had he done that?
segment_1120.wav|Apes like that, he replied, raided his crops that he grew to feed his family.
segment_1121.wav|Who was I to tell him that he should not do so?
segment_1122.wav|Rainforests are particularly precious habitats.
segment_1123.wav|the most biodiverse places in the world.
segment_1124.wav|More than half of the landliving species on the planet are found in their green depths.
segment_1125.wav|They grow in moist tropical regions where there's an abundance of those two resources that nearly all plants need, fresh water and sunshine.
segment_1126.wav|Close to the equator.
segment_1127.wav|The sun shines for 12 hours each day.
segment_1128.wav|with such reliability that there are virtually no seasons.
segment_1129.wav|Air currents collect water from all over the tropics and drench the forest with up to four meters of rain a year.
segment_1130.wav|And the forest also circulates its own water.
segment_1131.wav|Moisture from a trillion transparent leaves rising as mists each morning as the sun warms to full power.
segment_1132.wav|only ultimately to fall again as rain.
segment_1133.wav|The supreme suitability of these places for plants results in the greatest and most vigorous competition for space that occurs anywhere on Earth.
segment_1134.wav|Giant trees soaring 40 meters into the air stretch out their massive branches in all directions to claim the light.
segment_1135.wav|Together they create something that is very rare on land.
segment_1136.wav|a truly three-dimensional habitat.
segment_1137.wav|Beneath a crowning canopy, the branches serve as highways to all parts of the forest for those that are unable to fly.
segment_1138.wav|Way below on the dark floor, a tangle of massive roots and tiny threads give stability to the huge trunks.
segment_1139.wav|Thousands of other plants support themselves in a multitude of ways.
segment_1140.wav|Some rise to claim a place in the sun by climbing up the tree trunks from below.
segment_1141.wav|Others, perhaps deposited as seeds by birds, established themselves on the massive branches.
segment_1142.wav|Still more live close to the ground in the relative darkness.
segment_1144.wav|on such sustenance as can be derived from a carpet of dead leaves.
segment_1145.wav|And within and throughout this vegetation there are animals.
segment_1146.wav|Small species greatly outnumber the large ones.
segment_1147.wav|There are numerous invertebrates, small mammals and birds.
segment_1149.wav|Bart Norahs, sap suckers, flower lickers, fruit pickers, leaf cutters.
segment_1150.wav|Their interdependent lives are never failingly wonderful to the naturalist who tries to disentangle them.
segment_1151.wav|Wasps can be found that spend most of their lives with tiny figs.
segment_1152.wav|Frips that roll themselves up in flowers.
segment_1153.wav|Tadpoles that swim in the cups of vase plants.
segment_1154.wav|lizards that disguise themselves with fringes and tatters of skin.
segment_1155.wav|so that they're completely invisible on a tree trunk.
segment_1156.wav|until they move.
segment_1157.wav|Rainforests are places where evolutionary innovation and experimentation runs wild.
segment_1158.wav|The absence of seasons in the tropics gives a timelessness to the forest that encourages biodiversity.
segment_1159.wav|since the plants are not tied to a climatic calendar.
segment_1160.wav|They're flowering, fruiting and production of seeds.
segment_1161.wav|can happen at any time.
segment_1162.wav|Some trees fruit more or less continuously.
segment_1163.wav|Others grow for months, even years, between sudden flurries of blossoming and fruit production.
segment_1164.wav|So pollination, fruit eating and collecting seeds are not seasonal activities in the rainforest as they are in the forests of the north and south.
segment_1165.wav|Food is available the year round.
segment_1166.wav|a harvest that is exploited by dozens of different species from scores of different animal groups.
segment_1167.wav|Most of the millions of species exist in small numbers.
segment_1168.wav|and have limited range and many have become highly specialized.
segment_1169.wav|One species of insect may live on just one species of plant.
segment_1170.wav|perched on one species of tree.
segment_1171.wav|The result is a baffling complexity of interconnected relationships.
segment_1172.wav|every three years.
segment_1173.wav|a critical component of the whole.
segment_1174.wav|The orangutan that so haunted my memory.
segment_1176.wav|The species is widely dispersed in the forests of Borneo and Sumatra.
segment_1177.wav|but it performs a crucial role in the sea dispersal of many kinds of canopy trees.
segment_1178.wav|Orangutan mothers spend ten years with their single babies.
segment_1179.wav|teaching them when and how to collect dozens of different fruits.
segment_1180.wav|being large animals and almost entirely vegetarian.
segment_1181.wav|They consume a great deal each day and have to travel continuously in search of crops of ripe fruit.
segment_1182.wav|They either spit out the seeds on the spot...
segment_1183.wav|or carry them in their stomachs for days before dropping them, together with lumps of fertilizer, several kilometres away.
segment_1184.wav|Both methods improve the chances of seed germination and in some cases are essential for it to happen.
segment_1185.wav|It's the astonishing variety of tree species in rainforests that underpins their great biodiversity.
segment_1186.wav|It's also the characteristic that we are removing.
segment_1187.wav|I visited the forests of Southeast Asia many times for various programs over the years.
segment_1188.wav|Beginning in the 1960s, Malaysia, then Indonesia, began to replace the dizzying diversity of their rainforest trees.
segment_1189.wav|with just one kind.
segment_1191.wav|There were two million hectares of oil palm plantation in Malaysia by the time I visited it in 1989.
segment_1192.wav|for a series called Trials of Life.
segment_1193.wav|I remember travelling along a river searching for proboscis monkeys.
segment_1194.wav|We were surrounded by the familiar curtain of green with birds erupting from the foliage every minute or so.
segment_1195.wav|Perhaps I allowed myself to believe.
segment_1197.wav|but on flying back over the area.
segment_1198.wav|I saw the forest for what it was.
segment_1199.wav|a strip about a half a mile wide fringing the water.
segment_1200.wav|A forest so narrow and exposed that it would undoubtedly be degrading each day.
segment_1201.wav|beyond it and stretching for as far as I could now see from the air.
segment_1202.wav|There was nothing.
segment_1203.wav|but a single species of tree.
segment_1205.wav|in regimented rows.
segment_1206.wav|The disappearance of this rich and remarkable forest
segment_1207.wav|has been extremely difficult to accept.
segment_1208.wav|The Southeast Asians were simply doing what we in Europe and North America had already done.
segment_1209.wav|Satellite shots of either continent today show that the landscape now consists of small islands of dark green forest.
segment_1210.wav|separated by vast tracts of cultivated fields.
segment_1211.wav|The truth is, there has always been a double incentive to cut down forests.
segment_1212.wav|People benefit from the timber.
segment_1213.wav|and then benefit again from farming the land that has been exposed.
segment_1214.wav|It'll wonder that homo sapiens is such a determined and effective destroyer of forests.
segment_1215.wav|It has been estimated...
segment_1216.wav|that we now have three trillion fewer trees across the world.
segment_1217.wav|than at the start of human civilization.
segment_1218.wav|What is happening today is just the latest chapter.
segment_1219.wav|in the process of global deforestation.
segment_1220.wav|that has been operating for millennia.
segment_1221.wav|Now it's the turn of the rainforest.
segment_1222.wav|And as with everything in the latter half of the 20th century, the latter half of my life.
segment_1223.wav|We're working on a scale and at a speed that increases by the year.
segment_1224.wav|Half of the world's rainforests have already gone.
segment_1225.wav|Borneo's population of Orangutan cannot live without the forest.
segment_1226.wav|and it has been reduced by two thirds since I first saw one.
segment_1227.wav|just over 60 years ago.
segment_1228.wav|Orang-otans are still easy to find and film, not because they're abundant.
segment_1229.wav|but because so many of them now live in sanctuaries and rehabilitation centres.
segment_1230.wav|cared for by conservationists, alarmed by the pace of the loss they see about them.
segment_1231.wav|We cannot continue to cut down rainforests forever.
segment_1232.wav|and anything that we can't do forever is by definition unsustainable.
segment_1233.wav|If we do things that are unsustainable...
segment_1234.wav|the damage accumulates to a point where ultimately the whole system collapses.
segment_1235.wav|No habitat.
segment_1236.wav|no matter how big.
segment_1238.wav|1997.
segment_1239.wav|World population 5.9 billion.
segment_1240.wav|Carbon in the atmosphere
segment_1241.wav|360 parts per million.
segment_1242.wav|Remaining Wilderness
segment_1243.wav|46%
segment_1244.wav|The largest habitat of all is the ocean.
segment_1245.wav|It covers over 70% of the Earth's surface, but because of its great depths.
segment_1246.wav|It accounts for 97% of our planet's inhabitable space.
segment_1247.wav|Life on Earth almost certainly began there, probably as microbes living around jets of hot water.
segment_1248.wav|discharging from vents in the ocean floor several kilometers below the surface.
segment_1249.wav|For three billion years, natural selection worked on such single, simple, isolated cells.
segment_1250.wav|refining their internal workings.
segment_1251.wav|It took 1.5 billion years for cells to reach a structural complexity comparable with that of the cells of which we are made.
segment_1252.wav|and a further 1.5 billion
segment_1253.wav|before such cells clumped together and worked in a coordinated way, as they do in a multicellular organism.
segment_1254.wav|The early marine microbes had metabolisms that released methane as a by-product.
segment_1255.wav|it bubbled to the surface and slowly changed the Earth's atmosphere.
segment_1256.wav|Earth was a much cooler place at the time.
segment_1257.wav|Methane is a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide
segment_1258.wav|and its presence in the atmosphere.
segment_1259.wav|caused the planet to begin to warm.
segment_1260.wav|so helping life to proliferate.
segment_1261.wav|Later, microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria began to photosynthesise, using energy from the sun's rays to build their tissues.
segment_1262.wav|The exhaust gas of that process, oxygen...
segment_1263.wav|caused a revolution.
segment_1264.wav|It became the standard fuel for a much more efficient way of extracting energy from food.
segment_1265.wav|and so paved the way.
segment_1266.wav|for the establishment of all complex life.
segment_1267.wav|cyanobacteria still constitute a significant part of the phytoplankton that floats today in the upper levels of the ocean.
segment_1268.wav|You and I and all the animals with which we share the land are all ultimately descended from marine creatures.
segment_1269.wav|We owe the ocean everything.
segment_1270.wav|In the late 1990s...
segment_1271.wav|filmmakers in the BBC's Natural History Unit.
segment_1272.wav|proposed making a series devoted entirely to life in the sea.
segment_1274.wav|the blue planet.
segment_1275.wav|The seas are the most difficult and expensive of all environments in which to film, and about the hardest places of all in which to record animal behaviour.
segment_1277.wav|poor water visibility and difficulty in simply finding animals in the vast three-dimensional expanses of the ocean.
segment_1278.wav|can ruin any filming day.
segment_1279.wav|But the ocean also offered great opportunities for new, startling perspectives on the natural world.
segment_1280.wav|The first to show them on television was a Viennese biologist called Hans Haas.
segment_1281.wav|Who? Accompanied by his wife Lottie?
segment_1282.wav|filmed in the Red Sea.
